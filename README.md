This mod was intended for the [Item interactions](https://modrinth.com/resourcepack/item-interactions) resource pack.
if you want to know how to make a resource pack that implements particles make sure to look [in the wiki](https://github.com/mineland-2048/item_interactions_mod/wiki) 

There is also a section for showing off resource packs using the mod in [here](https://github.com/mineland-2048/item_interactions_mod/discussions/8) 

<hr>

The main animation settings are:

<table>

<tr> <th>speed</th> <th>scale</th> </tr>

<tr> 
  
<td>
  
  ![Speed](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mineland-2048/mineland-2048.github.io/refs/heads/main/other/texture%20packs/gallery/speed.webp)
  
</td>

<td style="align-content: center">
  
  ![Scale](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mineland-2048/mineland-2048.github.io/refs/heads/main/other/texture%20packs/gallery/scale.webp)
